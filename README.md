## Activity: Python Keras
A Machine Learning activity taken from the hands-on sessions at the 2023 Exotic Beam Summer School at Michigan State (FRIB), pulled from the following GitHub: https://github.com/alpha-davidson/ICTP-IAEA-2023. 
Constructs a dense neural network to predict the invariant mass of a particle from its energy, momentum, (and charge). Note that this task does not require machine learning. We choose a task with a known mapping to help us create, debug, and tune our first neural network.
